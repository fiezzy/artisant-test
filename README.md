## Test task for an interview in Artisant.io

This application is a mini nft marketplace (mini therefore you canâ€™t buy anything), but at the same time you can view the NFT catalog, sort by those that are available, go to the page with a specific NFT, and see the following information:

1. See the image in a larger view
2. Read the full description of the NFT you are viewing
3. See the author of the NFT
4. Get links to a number of services from a given NFT (etherscan, opensea, rarible)
5. See other works of the author of this NFT
